# Go client for Schema Registry

**schemaregistry** is a Golang client for [Schema Registry](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-schema-registry/), a software that provides a RESTful interface for developers to define standard schemas for their events, share them across the organization, and safely evolve them in a way that is backward compatible and future proof.
Using this client allows developers to build Golang programs that write and read schema compatible records to/from [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) using [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/), [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), and [JSON Schemas](https://json-schema.org) while Schema Registry is used to manage the schemas used.
Using this architecture, producers programs interact with Schema Registry to retrieve schemas and use it to serialize records. Then consumer programs can retrieve the same schema from Schema Registry to deserialize the records.
